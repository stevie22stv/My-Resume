        <h2>Experience Summary</h2>
        <h3>HSBC Bank PLC (2001 - Present)</h3>

        <h4>HSBC – Global Head of Mortgage Technology</h4>

        <p>As Global Head of Mortgage Technology my focus was on streamlining and digitising the 
            Mortgage process across the Group and to support the digitalisation of the Mortgage business.</p>

        <p>In 2018 I brought together the Mortgage Technology capabilities across the Group to establish 
            the Mortgage Technology service line within Retail Products, to support the transformation of the Mortgage 
            Business to meet the demands of the modern-day customer in the Digital age.</p>

        </p>A key strategy continuing on from the Mortgage Transformation Programme has been the delivery of a cloud 
            based, ‘containerised’ micro-service API framework, with central data store (single source of truth) and 
            workflow capability to support flexible & customized Digital journeys, streamlined / automated Business 
            processes and integration to HSBC systems and utilities, while enabling the use of FinTech solutions.</p>

        <p>MPO has been implemented into 5 major markets to date with a further 4 markets lined up in 2023, with the 
            aim of having more that 80% of Mortgage Business onto the strategic framework by end of 2025.</p>


        <h4>HSBC – Global IT Lead for Mortgage Transformation</h4>

        <p>Lead the Global Mortgage Transformation Programme within IT, working with the Business to define a Mortgage 
            Business Framework and to deliver a multi-channel Mortgage account opening and on-boarding solution 
            across the Group.</p>

        <p>I was responsible for the delivery of the Mortgage application journey and supporting framework in both 
            the Customer and Agent channel, covering Desktop and Mobile devices, overseeing the full lifecycle of the 
            programme from the shaping of Business Requirements into product features to the deployment and rollout to 
            target markets across the Group.</p>

        <p>Key achievements within the role have been the creation of a Global engineering team, the implementation of 
            agile methodologies and new technologies within engineering and the establishment of a strong product and 
            an evolving feature roadmap.</p>


        <h4>HSBC – IT Programme Manager</h4>

        <p>Programme Manager of the UK Mortgage Transformation Programme, which was a 4-year programme to implement a 
            multi-channel account opening & on-boarding Mortgage solution.</p>

        <p>This was a $60m+ engineering programme involving a development team of over 280 engineers across 4 countries 
            and 8 locations, delivering a straight through online Mortgage solution, covering public website calculators, 
            application data capture, through to credit decisioning, underwriting, valuations and conveyancing up to a 
            Mortgage Offer with online acceptance… the first of its kind at the time in UK and Europe.</p>

        <p>As IT Programme Manager, I oversaw the full lifecycle of the programme from the finalising of Business Requirements 
            to the deployment and rollout to primarily the Agent Channel and subsequently to the Customer Channel. This also 
            covered stakeholder management and reporting at various levels including the UK Mortgages steering group.</p>

        <h4>HSBC – Systems Manager</h4>

        <p>Joined the SE Quick Win department, which was formed to bring together the existing agile development teams and 
            small enhancements within Software Engineering (SE) into one discipline in the UK.</p>

        <p>My role was as deputy to the head of department and strategist for the Quick Win space, which initially involved 
            producing a re-organisation proposal and terms of reference for shaping the aims and objectives of the 
            newly formed team.</p>

        <p>As part of my role I produced a number of strategy and productivity papers and terms of reference, including 
            defining a target operating model and development life cycle to shape Quick Win as a discipline. A big part of 
            the role was communicating the Quick Win strategy and technologies via brochures, presentations and demos to the 
            Business and other areas in IT.</p>

        <p>I also fed into the Software Engineering productivity initiative, providing input on productivity gains and life cycle 
            activities, actively participating in a work stream to shape the target operating model.</p>

        <p>I also ran an initiative to deliver low cost agile capabilities to Software Development UK, working with UK Architecture 
            to identify and carry out research on a number of candidate technologies and then taking the chosen technology and 
            delivering a number of pilot solutions.</p>
